for some times, i was really into steganography and cryptography. so there are meaningless, mostly never used and published idea and code.
the first code may seem stupid, where in fact are stupid! the code will publish in future, may seem extremly genius or well craft or whatever but in fact, they are extremly stupid!
for example:
in the first codes we will publish, you will face with method could carry few byte of data, had no encryption and bla bla bla.
yet i think they work better in real world! for example if we assume there are real case for using this stuff then complicated and almost unpossible code to detect with any algorithm, where can carry more byte of string even an image, or encrypted aes standard text just inside another text seem wow!
but... why?
